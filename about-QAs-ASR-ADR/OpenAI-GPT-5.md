Here’s a concise, practical overview of Quality Attributes, ADRs, and ASRs, and how they fit together in solution/software architecture.

1) Quality Attributes (QAs)
- What they are: System properties that describe how well the system performs its functions (non-functional requirements). Examples: performance, availability, scalability, security, modifiability, testability, usability, observability, portability, deployability, fault tolerance, compliance, cost.
- Why they matter: They drive key architectural structures, technology choices, and trade-offs more than most individual functional requirements.
- How to specify them: As testable scenarios, not vague aspirations.

  A good Quality Attribute Scenario includes:
  - Source: who/what triggers it (e.g., user, system, operator)
  - Stimulus: the condition (e.g., sudden 5x traffic spike)
  - Environment: normal, degraded, maintenance, disaster
  - Artifact: what part of system is affected
  - Response: what the system should do
  - Response measure: quantification (SLO/SLA)

  Example scenarios:
  - Performance: Under normal operations, mobile clients send search requests at 2k RPS. The API responds with p95 latency ≤ 300 ms and p99 ≤ 600 ms.
  - Availability: During a single-AZ failure, the service remains available with ≤ 1 minute of error rates > 1%, and RTO ≤ 15 minutes; RPO = 0 for committed orders.
  - Security: For administrative actions, enforce MFA; all actions are auditable and tamper-evident, with logs retained for 1 year.
  - Modifiability: A single team can add a new payment provider in ≤ 3 days without coordinated releases across other teams.

- Architecture tactics often used:
  - Performance: caching, asynchronous processing, connection pooling, batching, load shedding, backpressure, resource isolation.
  - Availability: health checks, redundancy, failover, circuit breakers, graceful degradation, bulkheads, automated recovery.
  - Scalability: horizontal scaling, sharding/partitioning, stateless services, autoscaling policies, CQRS.
  - Security: least privilege, centralized authn/z, secrets management, encryption, input validation, audit logging.
  - Modifiability: layering, interfaces, dependency inversion, plugin architecture, configuration over code, bounded contexts.
  - Observability: structured logging, metrics, traces, golden signals, correlation IDs.

2) ASR — Architecturally Significant Requirements
- What they are: The subset of requirements (often QA scenarios, but also constraints and pivotal functional needs) that have a measurable, high impact on the architecture.
- Typical sources:
  - Quality attributes with hard thresholds (e.g., “p99 latency ≤ 200 ms”).
  - Constraints: regulations (PCI-DSS, HIPAA), tech choices (must run on `AWS GovCloud`), legacy integration, budget/time limits.
  - High-impact functional requirements: e.g., multi-tenancy, offline-first, real-time collaboration.
- How to identify ASRs:
  - Ask: Would this requirement change the architecture or tech selection if it shifted by 20–50%?
  - Prioritize by risk (uncertainty × impact), cost-of-change, alignment to business goals.
  - Use workshops (e.g., QAW) and scenario ranking; validate via ATAM-style tradeoff analysis.
- Output format (concise example list):
  - Availability: 99.95% monthly, single-region failure tolerant.
  - Performance: Checkout p99 ≤ 250 ms at 5k RPS sustained, 10k RPS for 1 hour peaks.
  - Compliance: PCI-DSS SAQ-D; cardholder data never stored at rest.
  - Modifiability: Add a product attribute end-to-end within 1 day by one team.
  - Data: Order writes must be strictly consistent; reads may be eventually consistent within 2 seconds.

3) ADR — Architecture Decision Record
- What it is: A lightweight, versioned note capturing a significant architectural decision, its context, alternatives, and consequences. Kept close to code (e.g., `docs/adr/` in the repo).
- Why use ADRs: Improves traceability, team alignment, onboarding, and future refactoring by making the why explicit. They connect ASRs to concrete design choices.
- Common ADR template (MADR/adr-tools style):
  - Title: Short, imperative (e.g., Use `PostgreSQL` for transactional storage)
  - Status: Proposed | Accepted | Deprecated | Superseded
  - Context: Problem, forces, relevant ASRs/constraints
  - Decision: What we chose
  - Alternatives: Options considered with pros/cons
  - Consequences: Positive/negative outcomes, obligations (runbooks, costs)
  - Links: Related ADRs, tickets, RFCs, proofs/spikes
- Example ADR (abridged):
  - Title: Use `PostgreSQL` for orders service OLTP
  - Status: Accepted
  - Context: Need ACID transactions for order lifecycle; ASRs: strict consistency for writes; p99 ≤ 250 ms; team expertise; need UUIDs, JSON fields, and read replicas.
  - Decision: `PostgreSQL 15` on `AWS RDS` with Multi-AZ; `pgBouncer` for pooling; logical replication for read scaling.
  - Alternatives:
    - `MongoDB`: Flexible schema but weaker transactional guarantees and more complex multi-document ACID patterns.
    - `CockroachDB`: Strong consistency and scale-out but higher operational complexity and cost; overkill for current scale.
  - Consequences: Meet consistency and latency goals; vendor lock-in to RDS features; need schema migrations (`sqitch`), backup/restore drills, and capacity planning.

How they relate
- Business goals → QAs (expressed as scenarios) → subset becomes ASRs (the ones that materially affect architecture) → architects/teams make decisions to satisfy ASRs → decisions are captured in ADRs → design/deployment artifacts implement decisions → tests/SLIs/SLOs verify QAs in CI/CD and in production.
- Not every QA is an ASR; not every decision needs an ADR. Use judgment: if a change could alter system structure, cross-team interfaces, or major infrastructure, it’s ADR-worthy.

Working process you can adopt
- Elicit and prioritize:
  - Run a Quality Attribute Workshop with stakeholders.
  - Write QA scenarios; rank by business value and risk.
  - Mark ASRs with clear thresholds and constraints.
- Analyze and design:
  - Explore tactics and patterns; run trade-off exercises (ATAM-lite).
  - Spike risky options; measure against scenarios.
- Decide and record:
  - Create ADRs for key choices (data stores, integration styles, tenancy model, sync vs async, cloud region strategy, auth system, observability stack).
  - Link ADRs to ASRs and to tickets.
- Verify and govern:
  - Turn scenarios into tests: load tests, chaos experiments, security scans.
  - Define SLIs/SLOs aligned to QAs; monitor in production.
  - Review ADRs periodically; supersede as context changes.

Quick examples by domain
- Web API:
  - ASRs: p99 ≤ 300 ms at 3k RPS; 99.95% availability; zero-downtime deploys.
  - ADRs: Choose `Kubernetes` with rolling updates and `HPA`; adopt `Redis` cache; enforce idempotent APIs with `POST`-`PUT` semantics; use `OpenTelemetry`.
- Data platform:
  - ASRs: Batch pipeline must process 1 TB within 2 hours; GDPR right-to-erasure within 30 days.
  - ADRs: Use `Apache Spark` on `EMR`; implement data lineage with `OpenLineage`; partition by event date; add delete vectors for erasure.

Tips and pitfalls
- Make QAs measurable; avoid “performant,” “secure,” “scalable” without numbers.
- Keep ADRs short and discoverable; one decision per file, e.g., `docs/adr/0007-use-postgresql.md`.
- Revisit ASRs as the product and scale evolve; supersede ADRs rather than editing history.
- Balance local vs global decisions: centralize only those impacting cross-team interoperability or platform cost/risk.
- Ensure traceability: each ASR should map to one or more ADRs and to validation tests/SLIs.

If you share your context (domain, constraints, current stack), I can help draft your initial ASR list and a set of ADRs to cover your high-impact choices.
